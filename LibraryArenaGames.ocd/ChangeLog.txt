# Fixed a problem where weapons were collected from spawn points while the user was contained (bug 13414)

* Updated version of all definitions to 8,0
* Moved assertion to OC repository

! Goals: Renamed definitions
         Library_ConfigurableGoal => Library_Goal_Configurable
         Library_IndividualGoal => Library_Goal_ForPlayer
         Library_TeamGoal => Library_Goal_ForTeam 
! Goals: Renamed functions
         DoScore  => DoFactionScore
         GetScore => GetFactionScore, 
         SetScore => SetFactionScore
         The old functions still exist, but change the value for the player's faction.
! Renamed RelaunchContainerEx to Arena_RelaunchContainer
! RelaunchContainerEx now respawns the crew at its position, instead of above it
! Split Library_ScenarioScript_PlayerRespawn into two additional plugins:
  Plugin_ScenarioScript_PlayerRespawn_RandomLocation, Plugin_ScenarioScript_PlayerRespawn_StartEquipment


- Removed the weapon menu from Arena_RelaunchContainer
